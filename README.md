# Warp

## 3D Boss Fight game
Environement and characters -> WIP in Blender + building ref bookmarks for procedural generations 

## Specialised Game Engine
Keep engine minimal, updates according to the needs in render and UI of the game.
Make sure to keep every functionality built for this first game as part of the core engine whenever possible.

### Sdf integration
The concept behind warp Engine is to figure how I can integrate Sdf shapes and interesting shader effects easily in a small boss encouter 3D game.
The goal will be as much as possible to test and experiment for performances and ease of use between classic graphics techniques and procedural renders.

### Vulkan
Using Vulkan graphics API
